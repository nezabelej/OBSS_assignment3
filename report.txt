BSIP, assignment3: Detecting contours of human organs in CT images using the Marr-Hildreth edge detector

Our task was to write a program for detecting contours of human organs in the CT images from the CTMRI DB using the Marr-Hildreth edge detector. 

Steps:
1. Accept a .png file which represents a CT image.
2. Calculate sigma.
3. Calculate coefficients of the LoG operator (mask).
4. Apply this mask on the image to enhance edges.
5. Searching for zero crossings and perform binarization.
6. The output is the binarized image.
7. The program displays the original image, the binarized image and the final image after edge linking. 

Zero crossings are the key feature of the Marr-Hildreth edge detection method. The Marr-Hildreth algorithm was implemented with the following approach:

- We used a 3 x 3 neighborhood centered at p,
- the signs of at least two of opposing neighboring pixels of a pixel p considered must differ.
- the neighboring pixels absolute difference must be less then threshold T

Results shows that edge detector successfully detects edges.
