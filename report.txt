Detecting contours of human organs in CT images using the Marr-Hildreth edge detector

Our task was to detect contours of human organs in the CT images from the CTMRI DB
using Marr-Hildreth edge detector.

The program first determines the size of the LoG operator and then calculates coefficients of the
LoG operator. The program then applies this mask to the image to enhance edges. The edges are then obtained by searching for zero crossings.

Zero crossings are the key feature of the Marr-Hildreth edge detection method.  We used the following approach:

- We used a 3 x 3 neighborhood centered at p,
- the signs of at least two of opposing neighboring pixels of a pixel p considered must differ.
- the neighboring pixels absolute difference must be less then threshold T

Results shows, that edge detector successfully detects edges, but a lot is dependent on the parameters we use.
